            <h2>Agri-fintech startups are filling the gaps in the agricultural value chain by improving FPOs and farmers' economies</h2>

                <p>One of the rising trends in the agricultural landscape is the emergence of agri-fintech startups, which are working to level the field of marginal farmer communities to build ties with the market. Its raging popularity is due to the induction of digital aesthetics to improve agricultural value chain financing by working with farmers/FPOs on bettering their productivity and economies.</p>
                <p>Unlike traditional practices of farming and lending, this is a transparent, uniform, and technology-backed system which simplifies things for farmers. It advocates the growth of farmers/FPOs, paving the way for a booming market. But before we dwell on the intricacies, let’s understand the concept of agri-fintech startups.</p>
                <p>A crucial aspect of the Indian farming system is that it is more regulated than structured. Agriculture is prevalent across the mainland, communities, and classes. There are big farmers with acres of land, and then there are those with a meager plot. Disparities in crop yield, harvesting methods, and market dynamics persist across different regions, contributing to inconsistencies in agricultural practices. As a result, financial institutions are unable to identify trustworthy benchmarks to establish creditworthiness, initiating a downward spiral of inadequate funding and reduced productivity, which adversely affects the ancillary industries as well.</p>

            <p>A commercial investment occurs when an investor commits money or capital to purchase a for-profit property or business. This enterprise may be a partial investment as part of a group effort or may be purchased by a single investor. Some of the most common examples of commercial investments include real estate properties, such as apartment complexes, office buildings, hotels or industrial complexes.</p>
            <p>Investing in commercial property can involve several pros and cons. Two of the positive aspects are measurable income, or profit potential, and relatively passive income.

                Savvy investors who have a knack for spotting up-and-coming neighborhoods on the cusp of rapid growth can get relative bargains before the local market soars. Of course, as with most things in real estate, it’s all about “location, location, location.” Your profit potential will depend in large part on the location, and how property values and rental markets in that area are performing. In many areas, commercial and multi-unit properties tend to increase in value at a higher rate than residential properties.</p>
            <p>Any type of property is subject to damages, breakdowns or other headaches you may not anticipate. This maintenance could range from fire or flood damage to a malfunctioning air conditioner or furnace. Depending on the situation, insurance may help recoup part of the costs, but it is smart to have a repair or emergency fund to help cover the costs of any needed repairs..</p>
